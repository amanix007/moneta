# Moneta

Moneta is a Javascript- and Node.js-based learning application that (will) implements a spaced-repetition system (SRS) to maximize learning efficiency. It is inspired by open source projects such as Anki and Mnemosyne, and like both of those projects its name is a reference to the word 'memory' itself. (I've toyed with naming it 'zakhar,' which means to remember in Hebrew, but that struck me as vain).
