      <p>Moneta is a Javascript- and Node.js-based learning application that (will) implements a spaced-repetition system (SRS) to maximize learning efficiency. It is inspired by open source projects such as Anki and Mnemosyne, and like both of those projects its name is a reference to the word 'memory' itself.</p>
